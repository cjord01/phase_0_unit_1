1. I learned that there’s a lot to learn. You could definitely spend a career/lifetime trying to master it. 
2. I do like design in general so I’ve had mixed emotions with a few of the last assignments. Even though I see this area as something I could excel at, I didn’t expect this to be what I’d be working on based on the prep work I had previously done with Ruby. I’ve had a little bit of a problem switching gears but I’m sure that once I wrap my brain around it some more that it will be something I enjoy. 
3. I had bookmarked a page for “Flat UI” colors a while back. I’ve found that this has made my design choices much easier since it limits me to a pallet of 20 colors. I like the simplicity in that. 
4. I was getting some funky characters in my text whenever I used an apostrophe but I was able to find the code to generate apostrophes that this is no longer an issue. 
5. Somewhat. This feels like an area that you could devote an entire career to so it’s hard to say I’m super confident after just a few articles. 
6. I’m enjoying the design elements more and more. My sites aren’t nearly as ugly as they were earlier in the week.
7. Compared to the power of Ruby, all of HTML feels tedious but I’m getting more comfortable with it.
