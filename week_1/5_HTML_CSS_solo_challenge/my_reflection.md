1. I’ve been taking pretty extensive notes as I’ve gone alone. That, along with the other HTML and CSS files I’ve created were enough to answer my questions.
2. I feel a little unclear on a lot of the positioning stuff but I think that’s because I have sort of a “why would I need this?” reaction to a lot of it. At the same time I’m sure it’s one of those things where if I had a better understanding of it I could see just how powerful and useful those features are. 
3. Playing around with the CSS stuff was kind of fun. Everything I’ve made so far looks pretty terrible so I would be nice to spend time studying stylistic stuff like complimentary colors, etc. 
4. Not super confident. I feel like this is something that I would have to spend a decent amount of time playing around with before I could make anything that looks decent. 
5. I like the idea of design so it’s exciting for me to make some of the style choice yet at the same time it’s a bit frustrating because I don’t know what goes well with what so everything I tried looked like shit. 
6. The whole thing felt a bit tedious. After spending the last few months working with Ruby, HTML feels kind of silly. Also, with so many user friendly services for getting basic websites up and running, HTML feels like a style that doesn’t have a lot of value. Seems like something more useful for a designer than a developer.
