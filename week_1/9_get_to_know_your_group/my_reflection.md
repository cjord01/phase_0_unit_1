Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

Hey guys,

My name is Clayton and I am from Glendale, AZ originally. I’ve been in Chicago since 2008.

For my favorite websites I chose Vimeo, SVPPLY (kind of like Pinterest), and VHX (distribution platform for independent filmmakers).

My Gregorc Thinking Style is Abstract Sequential and my VARK learning style is Read/Write with Aural close behind.

I guess that’s it. I feel like I’m missing something with this exercise.
