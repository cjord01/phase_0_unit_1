## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://cjord01.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

It sort of felt like more work than it actually was since writting about the sites is so much different than the other exercises I've been working on all day. The challenge was really just about switching gears into writter mode.

One thing I have not been able to figure out is how to get the blog link to show up with the CSS stuff. Right now it only shows the HTML so none of the polish I've been working on shows up.
