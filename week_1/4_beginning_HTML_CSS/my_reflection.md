1. It seems relatively straightforward. I get the feeling that with minimal experience and the right resources, Iâ€™d be able to get a basic site up fairly quickly. 
2. Some of the syntax seems like it would be hard to remember but I could still get the job done while looking stuff up as I go.
3. I had a bit of trouble linking up the HTML and CSS files but after some Googling and experimenting, I figured it out. 
4. No, but I do feel like I could spend more time on this section. I plan to circle back to it at the end of the week.
