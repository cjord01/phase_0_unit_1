* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

1. Nothing too frustrating. I think I understand the difference between the two.
2. Git only adds new information. So instead up updating files with changes, it only adds files that have been changed. Git is great because it allows you to work offline and with many contributors.
3. Version Control allows you to collaborate and track/revert changes.
4. It is a much easier way of collaborating. Imagine the difficulties of a team working off of a shared document for example if everyone it contributing to a single Powerpoint file it can get pretty messy and info can be lost.
5. So far I think I’m comprehending everything that’s being thrown by way.
