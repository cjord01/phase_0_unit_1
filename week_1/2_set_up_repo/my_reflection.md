## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. On Github - “new repository” -> name repository -> check “public” -> add a “MIT License” -> click “Create repository”
2. Allows others to freely use your code. 
3. It’s a bit counter intuitive but it’s a good thing. Without it then progress would be slowed. Computer Science (as with all science) is largely about standing on the shoulders of those who came before you.
4. Licenses allows you to open up the projects to the world while still getting credit for you work.
5. My original reflections didn’t save so I’m going back and reentering them now. I don’t remember having any huge struggles in this section. 
6. None.
