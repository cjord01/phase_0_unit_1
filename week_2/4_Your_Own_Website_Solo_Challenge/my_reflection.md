# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. I learned that there’s a lot to learn. I can definitely see how design and user experience can be a discipline in itself. Definitely not something that you’re going to master in a week.
2. Feels very tedious as this point. I didn’t hate it exactly but I think it will take a TON more experience before I’ll “like” it. 
3. It definitely felt like there was an organize checklist that happened as soon as I started. Wireframe, sections, text, links, images, then came the styling which was the hard part. I find HTML tedious and CSS a bit frustrating. Neither are necessarily “hard” but there’s a definite learning curve involved. Dev Tools is very helpful. When I was lost, I could just jump into another site’s code and see how they did stuff and figure out if that worked for my needs. 
4. I think it could be better formatted for mobile devices but I spent a pretty good amount of time on it so at some point you just have to say “that’s good enough for now.”
5. Sort of. I am excited to get to the point where it’s all a bit less of a mystery and then I can really tear into it and make some cool shit. 
6. Nothing new but I did work a little with QuirkTool which is a neat app.
