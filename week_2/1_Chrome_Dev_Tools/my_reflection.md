* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. DOM connects web pages to scripts or programming languages. It is a collection of all your HTML elements put into a tree format. I was not feeling that confident in my understanding of DOM; seems complicated. However, the Skillcrush explanation was more straightforward so I’m feeling a little better about it. 
2. There’s just not a whole lot going on on my site. It was all kind of thrown together with very little knowledge of HTML or CSS so it’s very basic. Every other site I’ve examined using Dev Tools seem complicated in comparison. 
3. Once I had a little understanding of just what Dev Tools is I was like, “WOW! This is going to make things a whole lot easier!”
4. I’ll still need a lot of time with Dev Tools but I’m very excited about it’s possibilities. The optimization part of it feels a bit over my head at this point but I’ll get the hang of it eventually.
