# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. Design by thinking of the structure of your website, and how different elements fit into the structure. It makes a lot of sense. Responsive design is pretty cool!
2. I was under the assumption that companies were still building separate desktop/mobile versions of their sites. Seems like smart phones and tables are what really pushed this forward. 
3. Never gave this much thought but of course it should be available. There’s a blink guy that works at my local Apple store so I always figured this was something that exists. 
4. It’s obvious that designing based on fixed number of pixels doesn’t make sense, but I was somewhat surprised that designing based on % isn’t that much better. Responsive design pushes past this. 
5. No but the QuirkTool is very cool and seems like a great resource. I haven’t checked yet but I would image that building your site based on the 2 or 3 most common desktop sizes, phone sizes, and tablet sizes would make the most sense.
