# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

1. I'm lucky because this is the only thing I have going right now so I'm able to put more time into phase 0 than most. I was expecting 10-15 hours/week of work and so far I've spent WAY more than that. I would imagine that most people have jobs right now and I can’t imagine getting through this work load while also holding down a full-time job. That said, my time spent on phase 0 assignments probably isn’t the most efficient because I have the luxury of ample time. 
2. If I can better focus and maximize my time then I’ll be able to circle back and better solidify the concepts that I don’t fully understand. 
3. Of the time management tips I’ve found, I think that setting a timer will be the most useful for me. I’ve tried the 25 minute timer for a few things so far and I’ve found that it’s helped quite a bit. This is something I will try to continue with.
4. I will set goals for each lesson and try to have everything completed by Friday of each week instead of Sunday. This will give me extra time to revisit the areas that I don’t feel as confident with. I’ve also had a tough time finding people to pair with. From what I’ve read, it sounds like the pairing is helpful for just about any part of the challenges so I plan to complete the challenges based on my schedule and hopefully I’m able to find people to pair with. If not, I don’t see anything wrong with pairing on things that I’ve already completed. This will help to better grasp these areas and hopefully I will be able to better assist the people I’m paired with.
