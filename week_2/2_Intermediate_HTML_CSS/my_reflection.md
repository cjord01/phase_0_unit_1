# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. It’s a good thing. The internet is the wild wild west which is sort of great but there needs to be some rules so that it all works. 
2. I think I have a decent understanding. Being able to group the different parts seems essential. 
3. Yes. Just using mostly ‘div’ for everything could get confusing. These new elements seem like an easier way to group stuff and keep it all straight. 
4. It helps to avoid cross-browser differences. 
5. So far I mostly use Safari and then use Chrome when I need to use dev tools. I don’t notice much of a difference between Safari and Chrome but for some of my challenges I’ve pulled the files up on my phone just to see how it looks and there are sometimes subtle differences. 
6. I partnered for this challenge and my partner recommended https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL41lfR-6DnOruqMacTfff1zrEcqtmm7Fv. I haven’t had a chance to check it out yet though.
