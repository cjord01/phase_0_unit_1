// My role in the group is: Person 1

// Here is my part of the challenge:

//I want to take two sets of numbers and find the total sum, mean, and median for each set of numbers. 
	//The above is really all of the information you should need but 
	// I've included some additional text just incase you want more 
	// clarification, but it's pretty much restating the above. 
		//I have two sets of numbers.
			//The first has an odd number of values. (this likely won't be important to you)
			//The second has an even number of values. (this likely won't be important to you)
		//I need to do three things to each set of numbers.
			//1. I need to add up the value of all the numbers in each set.
			//2. I need to find the mean (or average) of each set of numbers.
			//3. I need to find the median of each set of numbers.
